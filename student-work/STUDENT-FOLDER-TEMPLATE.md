# Student Work Template

## How to Use This Folder

Each student who forks this repository should:

1. **Create a personal folder** named after you (e.g., `firstname-lastname/` or your GitHub username)
2. **Use this folder as your workspace** for all MTEC 4502 assignments, reflections, and portfolio work
3. **Keep this folder organized** with subfolders for different assignments or project types
4. **Commit and push regularly** — your work is visible in version history

### Example Structure (for your folder):

```
student-work/
└── firstname-lastname/
    ├── assignments/
    │   ├── 01-career-strategy/
    │   ├── 02-career-visualization/
    │   ├── 03-portfolio-platforms/
    │   ├── 04-ai-portfolio/
    │   └── 05-resume-cover-letter/
    ├── reflections/
    ├── research-notes/
    └── portfolio-experiments/
```

### Guidelines

- **All work is your responsibility** — this is your professional archive
- **Commit messages should be clear** — describe what you've changed and why
- **Privacy:** If you need to keep information private, use `.gitignore`
- **Feedback:** Instructors and peers will review your work through commits and pull requests

**Note:** This template folder can be deleted once you've created your personal folder. Only keep your own workspace in `/student-work`.
