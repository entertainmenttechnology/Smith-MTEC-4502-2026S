### 0:20 – 1:50 | Student Portfolio Presentations
**Goal:** Students share ideas, get peer and instructor input.  
Each student presents for 8–10 minutes total (6 minutes presentation + 2–4 minutes discussion).  

**Each presentation should include:**  
1. Platform Chosen: Why this site suits their career or aesthetic.  
2. Portfolio Goal: What story they want the portfolio to tell.  
3. Structure / Sections: Planned pages or content (Bio, Resume, Projects, Contact, etc.).  
4. Design Ideas: Inspiration from examples, visual style, or layout concepts.  
5. Monetization or Professional Integration: How the site might support freelance, networking, or branding goals.  
6. Early Mockup or Reference Example: Screenshot, sketch, or existing portfolio they admire.  

**Instructor Prompts:**  
- What kind of audience are you designing for?  
- How does this portfolio demonstrate your core skills?  
- Is your layout easy to update or expand?  
- What design tone do you want — formal, creative, technical?  
- What do you want a visitor to remember after seeing your portfolio?  

Encourage peers to offer one positive comment and one constructive suggestion after each presentation.

### 1:50 – 2:15 | Group Discussion: Emerging Strategies
**Goal:** Synthesize patterns and best practices.  
Lead a reflective discussion:  
- Which platforms seem easiest to customize?  
- What layouts or storytelling styles were most engaging?  
- How are students balancing aesthetics with clarity?  
- Are there clear trends by discipline (design vs. tech vs. performance)?  
- How could AI tools assist with writing bios, formatting visuals, or site setup?  

Capture notes on the board or shared doc (for example, “Best tools for customization,” “Best for visibility,” “Best for integration”).

### 2:15 – 2:30 | Wrap-Up & Next Steps
**Goal:** Prepare students for the next development milestone.  
- Summarize key insights from presentations.  
- Clarify deliverables for next week:  
  - A working portfolio homepage (live link or prototype).  
  - At least one completed section (Bio, Resume, or Project).  
  - Documented AI or design tools used (for the AI Collaboration Report).  
- Encourage students to continue refining their structure using the Portfolio Design Resources list (IDEO, AIGA, NACE, etc.).  

**Homework / Deliverable:**  
- Develop the first stage of your portfolio:  
  - Create your homepage layout.  
  - Write your professional bio.  
  - Upload or format one project page.
