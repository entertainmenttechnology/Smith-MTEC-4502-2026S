# 🧭 Best Practices in Resume Development  
**For MTEC 4502 – Career and Portfolio Seminar**  

---

## I. Purpose and Philosophy
- A resume is not a biography — it’s a **strategic communication tool**.  
- The goal is to **align skills and experiences** with the expectations of your intended audience (employer, collaborator, client, or graduate program).  
- It must express both **competence and identity**, consistent with the tone of your portfolio.  
- Think of it as a **narrative interface**: the written version of your professional persona.  

---

## II. Resume Design Principles
### A. Clarity and Readability
- Prioritize **hierarchy and visual scanning** — recruiters spend 6–10 seconds on first review.  
- Use clear headings, concise bullet points, and white space.  
- Choose a clean, legible typeface (Helvetica, Lato, Roboto, Garamond).  
- Avoid unnecessary graphics unless applying to design fields where layout is part of the evaluation.  

### B. Consistency Across Materials
- Match design elements (fonts, colors, icons) with your **portfolio’s identity**.  
- Keep tone and language consistent between resume, cover letter, and online presence.  
- Use the same **keywords and phrasing** across GitHub, LinkedIn, and portfolio sites.  

### C. Formatting and Length
- **1 page** for entry-level or early career; **2 pages max** for experienced or interdisciplinary applicants.  
- Save and submit as a **PDF** to preserve layout.  
- Include **live links** to your portfolio, LinkedIn, GitHub, or professional email.

## III. Structural Elements
| Section | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Contact Info** | Establish identity and reachability | Include name, email, portfolio link, city, optional phone |
| **Professional Summary / Objective** | One-line statement of focus | Emphasize contribution (“I help create…” not “I’m looking for…”) |
| **Skills** | Snapshot of competencies | Group into Technical, Creative, and Soft Skills |
| **Experience** | Translate work into relevance | Highlight *impact* (“Developed an interactive installation…” not “Worked on project”) |
| **Education** | Academic foundation | Include degree, school, expected graduation |
| **Projects / Productions** | Core section for Emerging Media students | Describe collaboration, tools, and outcomes |
| **Awards / Certifications** | Add credibility | Include workshops, software certifications, etc. |
| **References** | Optional | “Available upon request” is acceptable |

---

## IV. Language and Tone
- Use **strong action verbs**: developed, produced, coordinated, designed, implemented, analyzed.  
- Quantify results where possible (“Reduced editing time by 30%”).  
- Avoid vague phrasing (“Responsible for…”).  
- Emphasize collaboration and agency — show initiative.  
- Maintain **parallel structure** across bullet points (each begins with a verb).  

---

## V. Tailoring and Customization
- Each resume should be **targeted** to a specific job or context.  
- Reorder or emphasize sections based on purpose (creative, technical, academic).  
- Extract keywords and core skills from job descriptions.  
- Keep a **master resume** with all experience; adapt a focused version for each application.  

---

## VI. Integration with AI Tools (Ethical Use)
Use AI as a **collaborator**, not a ghostwriter.  
- Evaluate tone and clarity.  
- Identify missing keywords or redundant phrasing.  
- Compare your resume against a job description or portfolio identity.  

**Recommended Tools:** ChatGPT, Gemini, Grammarly, Teal, Jobscan, Copilot.  
**Documentation Tip:** Note AI’s role in your process: “Used AI to evaluate tone and keyword alignment; final edits made manually.”  

---

## VII. Creative and Technical Field Considerations
- **Design / Media:** May use light visual accents, icons, or subtle color; ensure legibility.  
- **Technical / Development:** Prioritize skills and project outcomes; emphasize problem-solving.  
- **Hybrid Roles:** Showcase adaptability, teamwork, and interdisciplinary understanding.  

---

## VIII. Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Typos, inconsistent formatting, or broken links.  
- Walls of text with no white space.  
- Overused buzzwords (“innovative,” “team player”).  
- Listing tools without context (“Figma” vs. “Created UX prototypes in Figma for client app”).  
- Using outdated or overly decorative templates.

## IX. Evaluation Checklist
| Category | Question | Goal |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| **Readability** | Is the resume easy to scan? | Recruiter grasps core info in <10 seconds |
| **Relevance** | Does it align with the target job or field? | Highlights the most relevant skills |
| **Visual Design** | Is it professional and consistent? | Matches portfolio identity |
| **Narrative** | Does it tell a coherent story of growth? | Demonstrates development and focus |
| **Accuracy** | Are all details correct? | No factual or formatting errors |

---

## X. Reflection Prompts
For inclusion in AI Collaboration Report or journal:
- How did aligning your resume’s tone with your portfolio change its impact?  
- Which feedback (human or AI) most improved your clarity or identity?  
- Does your resume communicate trajectory as well as skill?  
- Which section best expresses your contribution to your field?

> “Your resume should read like a story of momentum — not a list of what you’ve done, but a map of where you’re going.”
