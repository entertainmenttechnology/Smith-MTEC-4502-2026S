# MTEC 4502 – Career and Portfolio Seminar
## Assignment 1a: Reflective Essay Draft on Career Strategy and Skill Assessment

---

### Purpose and Framing

This assignment represents the **Speculation phase** of the course’s project-development cycle. Its purpose is not to be correct, comprehensive, or market-aligned, but to **capture your current internal model** of your career direction before it is influenced by research, tools, peers, or formal frameworks.

You are being asked to slow down and articulate assumptions that often remain implicit: what you think you want, what you believe matters, and how you currently understand your own capabilities.

> **Important constraint:** For this assignment, you must not use outside resources of any kind. No job listings, no portfolio sites, no LinkedIn, no AI tools. This document should reflect only your present thinking, intuition, and lived experience.

You will have ample opportunity to revise, expand, and challenge these ideas later. The value of this draft lies precisely in its *incompleteness*.

---

## Assignment Objective

Your task is to draft a reflective essay that establishes a baseline for:
- Your current career aspirations
- The skills, knowledge, and tools you believe are important
- Your self-assessment of strengths and gaps
- Your early, provisional thoughts about strategy

This essay will later be revisited and compared against research findings, visualization exercises, and portfolio decisions developed throughout the semester.

## Essay Structure and Guiding Prompts

Your draft should be written as a continuous essay, but it must clearly address the sections below. You may use headings if helpful.

### 1. Introduction to Your Career Aspirations

In this section, describe where you currently *think* you are headed professionally.

You may consider:
- What types of roles, industries, or professional identities appeal to you right now?
- Are you aiming for a clearly defined role, or are you still exploring multiple directions?
- Are you considering a transition between disciplines, industries, or modes of work?
- What motivates your interest in these areas (creative fulfillment, stability, impact, curiosity, autonomy, etc.)?
- What kinds of professional activities do you imagine finding most rewarding?

Do not worry about realism or feasibility at this stage. This is a snapshot of intention, not a commitment.

### 2. Tools and Knowledge for Success

Identify the skills, forms of knowledge, and tools you *believe* are important for success in your intended direction.

Consider, but do not limit yourself to:
- Technical or disciplinary skills
- Conceptual or analytical abilities
- Communication, collaboration, or organizational skills
- Software, platforms, or technologies you think matter
- Ways of thinking or working that you associate with success in your field

At this stage, accuracy matters less than articulation. You are documenting your current mental model, not verifying it.

---

### 3. Self-Assessment

Provide an honest preliminary assessment of your current capabilities.

You may reflect on:
- Skills or areas where you feel confident
- Areas where you feel underprepared or uncertain
- Habits, strengths, or experiences that may differentiate you
- Gaps you already recognize, even if you do not yet know how to address them

Consider how your academic background, work experience, or personal interests shape your positioning—positively or negatively.

---

### 4. Conclusion with Initial Strategic Thoughts

Conclude by offering **early, tentative thoughts** about how you might move forward.

This may include:
- Broad ideas about addressing perceived gaps
- Ways you might leverage existing strengths
- Questions you already have about your direction
- Tensions or contradictions you notice in your own thinking

You are not expected to present a polished strategy here. This section simply signals how you are currently imagining progress.

---

## Submission Requirements

- Length: **750–1000 words**
- Format: Online, shareable document (Google Docs, OneDrive, etc.)
- Be prepared to share the link in class if requested
- Be prepared to discuss:
  - Your thinking process
  - Areas of confidence or uncertainty
  - Questions that emerged while writing

## Assessment Note

This draft is not evaluated for correctness, ambition, or market alignment. It is assessed based on:
- Completeness
- Clarity of thought
- Evidence of genuine reflection

You will revisit this document later in the semester. Its value increases over time.
