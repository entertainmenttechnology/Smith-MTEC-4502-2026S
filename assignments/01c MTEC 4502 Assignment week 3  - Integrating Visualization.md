### **Part 1: Research on Visualization Platforms**

#### **Steps:**

1. **Explore Different Platforms**:  
   * Research at least **three** visualization tools (e.g., **MindMeister**, **Trello**, **Lucidchart**, **Google Sheets**, **Coggle**, **Draw.io**).  
   * You may feel free to [use this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vR_qsRI_Jwelel1fbkBkFMks7o1ZEZLYYV_02eeUOmM/edit) which has a list of resources.  
   * Identify the features, ease of use, and limitations of each platform. Consider factors like:  
     * Collaboration features  
     * Flexibility in design  
     * Accessibility (free vs. paid features)  
     * Compatibility with your needs (mind maps, Gantt charts, timelines, etc.)  
2. **Deliverable**:  
   * **Write a comparison analysis (150-200 words)** of the platforms you researched.  
   * Clearly state which platform you’ve chosen for your career plan visualization and **explain why** it’s the best fit for your needs.

### **Part 2: Design the Structure of Your Visualization**

#### **Steps:**

1. **Choose Your Visualization Type**:  
   * Based on your research, decide whether you will use a **mind map**, **flow chart**, **Gantt chart**, or another visualization tool to organize your career strategy.  
   * Plan the structure of your visualization, considering the key components of your **Strategic Framework**:  
     * **Skills Gap Analysis**: Highlight the skills you need to develop.  
     * **Actionable Steps**: Break down your short- and long-term goals.  
     * **Timeline**: Organize your goals with milestones and deadlines.  
     * **Collaboration and Resources**: Identify how you will collaborate and which resources or tools you will use.  
2. **Deliverable**:  
   * **Draft a visual outline or structure** of your career plan using the platform you chose. You can present this as a screenshot or shared link to your initial rough draft of the visualization (e.g., mind map, Gantt chart).  
   * Include key areas for skills development, goals, and timelines, following the **Strategic Framework** format.

### **Part 3: Produce Your First Rough Draft**

#### **Steps:**

     * Key short-term and long-term goals  
     * A timeline for achieving your milestones  
     * Any resources, mentors, or tools you’ll use to support your development  
     * Areas where you may need to adjust based on flexibility and adaptability  
   * Keep in mind this is a rough draft, and you will refine it in future iterations.  
2. **Deliverable**:  
   * Submit the **first rough draft** of your visual career plan as a shareable file, link, or image.  
   * Add a **150-word reflection** on how the visualization process helped you organize your thoughts and structure your career strategy.
