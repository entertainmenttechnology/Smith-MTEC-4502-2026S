### **Objective** {#objective-1}

Your first task is to **draft a reflective essay.** This draft will serve as a foundation for considering your career goals, the essential skills and knowledge for your chosen field, and a self-assessment of the expertise you've accumulated.  We often do not deeply consider particular decisions, and it may be of great use to apply analytical methods towards strategies for future directions. DO NOT USE ANY OUTSIDE RESOURCES FOR THIS PART: YOU SHOULD ONLY BE RELYING ON YOUR INTERNAL STATE\! You will have plenty of time to develop using other resources after this exercise, but I consider it essential that you first place onto permanent storage ideas and concepts that are exclusively obtained through self-reflection and speculation.

### **Guidelines** {#guidelines}

Your draft should include the following sections.  
Introduction to Your Career Aspirations

* Briefly outline your career goals, including any thoughts on transitioning to a different sector or area.   
* Highlight the motivations behind your career choice and what you aim to achieve.  
* Describe the types of career activities that you would consider rewarding.  

Tools and Knowledge for Success

* Identify the specific skills, knowledge, and tools you feel will be crucial for success in your chosen career. 

Self-Assessment

* Provide a preliminary assessment of your current skills and knowledge. Discuss your strengths and areas for improvement, considering how your background might uniquely position you for success in your chosen career or a new field.


Conclusion with Initial Strategic Thoughts 

* Offer initial thoughts on your strategic plan for career development, including how you might address skill gaps and leverage your strengths.

### **Submission Requirements** {#submission-requirements}

* Your draft should be 750-1000 words in length.  
* Draft your essay using an online, shareable document format (Google Docs, OneDrive, etc.) and be prepared to share the link in class.
