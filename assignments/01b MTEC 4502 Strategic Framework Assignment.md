**Assignment part 1b: Strategic Framework for Career Path Planning**

## Objective:

The purpose of this assignment is to create an actionable, structured framework that guides you toward your career goals. You will analyze the data gathered from job listings, LinkedIn profiles, and AI-generated skills to identify gaps, align your career aspirations, and develop a plan for achieving professional success.

### Part 1: Job Requirements Analysis

Leverage the insights from job listings, LinkedIn profiles, and AI suggestions to perform a comprehensive job requirements analysis.

**Steps**:

1. **Research and Identify job listings:** Identify positions that are both entry level, mid-career, and senior: note we are looking for a long term path.  You can look for a variety of different sites such as LinkedIn, etc, and you can also take advantage of the department’s [Job Listings page](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/groups/entertainment-technology-student-resources/docs/entertainment-technology-jobs-and-internships/) to find different sites that focus on different job markets.  As well, searching directly in the browser, or working with AI to identify other potential sites are useful approaches.  
2. **Compare Job Listings**: Analyze the job listings you gathered, noting the required qualifications, skills, and responsibilities.  Build these into a table that allows you to list the competencies, the required amount, and your current capabilities in that area.  
3. **Link to Your Strategic Framework**: Connect this research to your strategic framework—how will these job requirements shape your short- and long-term career plans?  
4. **Document the Findings**: Summarize the common skills, experiences, and qualifications you identified, and map them to your action plan.

**Deliverable**:

* A table or list comparing at least **3-5 job listings**, highlighting common skills and qualifications.  
* A 150-word reflection on how the job listings impact your **Strategic Framework**.  
    
    
   

### Part 2: Skills Gap Analysis

This step involves comparing your current skills with the requirements from job listings relevant to your career goals. You’ll use both the real-world job market data and the AI-generated suggestions to refine your skillset.

**Steps**:

1. **Review Job Listings and LinkedIn**: Refer back to the job listings and LinkedIn profiles you researched. Identify the essential skills, qualifications, and experiences required.  
2. **AI vs. Human Research Comparison**: Compare the skills generated by AI with those from job listings and LinkedIn profiles. Identify areas where AI suggested new or additional skills not commonly found in your research.  
3. **Self-Assessment Reflection**: Compare these external data points with your current skills and identify the gaps.

**Deliverable**:

* A table or chart that lists **required skills** vs. **current skills** (skills you need to acquire based on your research and AI analysis).  
* A brief reflection (150-200 words) on your skills gap and what surprised you during the AI comparison.

### Part 3: Personal Alignment

Reflect on how your career path aligns with your personal values, long-term aspirations, and strengths.

**Steps**:

1. **Reflect on Personal Values**: Think about your career beyond skills—what do you want out of your professional life? (e.g., flexibility, creativity, collaboration, impact).  
2. **Align Career with Values**: Does your chosen career path match your personal values? If not, how will you adjust your goals or approach to better align?

**Deliverable**:

* A reflection (100-150 words) on how your career goals align (or don’t) with your personal values, and any adjustments you plan to make based on this reflection.

### Part 4: Actionable Steps (with Adaptability and Flexibility)

Develop a concrete plan for addressing the skill gaps you identified, and take proactive steps toward achieving your career goals. Make sure to include flexible milestones and be open to adapting your plan as opportunities or challenges arise.  This at this time can be only speculative:  we will continue our research in goals and timelines as we move forward.

**Steps**:

1. **Set Short- and Long-Term Goals**: Based on the gaps you identified, create **short-term goals** (6 months to 1 year) and **long-term goals** (1-3 years).  
2. **Resource Identification**: Research online resources, mentors, certifications, or workshops that can help you close the skills gap.  
3. **Create a Timeline**: Develop a timeline to achieve these goals, noting deadlines for skill acquisition, project completion, or networking events.  
4. **Build in Flexibility**: Acknowledge the dynamic nature of career paths and include checkpoints where you can reflect and adjust your plan.

**Deliverable**:

* A **list of goals** (both short-term and long-term).  
* A **timeline or Gantt chart** showing specific steps you will take and deadlines for meeting these goals.

### Part 5: Technology and AI Reflection

Consider how technology (especially AI) can play a role in your career planning and development.

**Steps**:

1. **Evaluate AI’s Role in Skill Development**: Reflect on how AI-generated skills helped shape your understanding of the skills needed for your career. Were there any unique insights AI offered?  
2. **Identify Tools for Your Career**: What tools, technologies, or platforms (AI, software, etc.) will you use to further develop your skills and career?

**Deliverable**:

* A reflection (100-150 words) on how AI and technology will support your career development.  
* A list of **technologies or tools** you plan to use.

### Part 6: Integration of Feedback

**Deliverable**:

* A reflection (100-150 words) on how you incorporated feedback into your Strategic Framework.
