### **Assignment 1d: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Your Project**

**Objective:**  
This assignment provides you with opportunities to integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a creative and analytical tool in various stages of your project development. From brainstorming to final revisions, the goal is to explore how AI can enhance your work while ensuring ethical usage and maintaining the integrity of your personal analysis and creativity.

**Assignment Components:**

1. **Research, Ideation, and Drafting (25%)**  
   * Use AI to **brainstorm ideas** related to your project. This could involve exploring different themes, generating new perspectives, or organizing thoughts. Document how AI contributed to your brainstorming process.  
   * **Structure your project** using AI-generated outlines or suggested content organization strategies. You are encouraged to experiment with different tools (such as ChatGPT, Jasper, or other AI writing assistants) to see how they assist in outlining or creating initial drafts.  
   * **Draft initial content** using AI. Use this as a way to overcome writer’s block or to explore new angles on a topic. Save the drafts, and note how much of the content was AI-generated versus your own contributions.  
2. **AI-Driven Feedback and Revision (25%)**  
   * Submit an early draft of your project to an AI tool that provides feedback (such as Grammarly, ChatGPT, or a similar AI-based editor). Focus on **feedback related to grammar, clarity, and content structure**. Document the types of feedback you received.  
   * Based on the AI feedback, **refine your draft**, noting changes and improvements made through this process. Reflect on how AI highlighted areas for improvement and how you applied the suggestions to elevate your work.  
   * Use additional peer or instructor feedback to **critically evaluate the AI suggestions**. Did the AI provide accurate and useful feedback, or did it miss crucial details? Discuss any inconsistencies or limitations of AI.  
3. **Documenting AI Use (20%)**  
   * **Keep a detailed record** of all AI interactions throughout your project. For each AI tool used, document:  
     * The platform and version (e.g., ChatGPT, Jasper, Grammarly).  
     * Specific **prompts** used to generate content or feedback.  
     * A brief description of how AI influenced the outcome of your project at different stages.  
     * Screenshots or links to AI interactions (if applicable).  
   * **Reflect on the ethical use of AI** in your assignment. Was AI used responsibly? How did you ensure that AI-generated content didn’t overshadow your personal creativity and analysis?  
4. **Critical Evaluation and Reflection (20%)**  
   * Write a **1-2 page reflection** on your experience using AI in your project. Discuss:  
     * **Benefits**: How did AI contribute to your creativity, provide new insights, or streamline the project?  
     * **Challenges**: What limitations did you encounter when using AI? Did AI present inaccurate or incomplete information? How did you address these issues?  
     * **Insights Gained**: What did you learn about AI as a tool for creative and analytical work? How did AI impact your thinking process and project development?  
5. **Ethical Consideration and Integrity (10%)**  
   * Address any **ethical considerations** in your final submission. Ensure that your final project reflects original thought, despite AI involvement. Credit any AI-generated content appropriately (if necessary) and provide a discussion on balancing **AI-generated content and personal effort**.

**Submission Requirements:**

* For each type of AI Activity, please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfTEMt7B2PZTV4lwCjujazKcuW7LZ088SgvcSXdseJwf_igxA/viewform?usp=sf_link): you may need to do more than one, if you were using AI for more than one part of your project.  
* A completed project using AI tools for brainstorming, drafting, feedback, and revision.  
* A detailed log of AI interactions, prompts, and platform usage.  
* A 1-2 page reflection on the use of AI, discussing benefits, limitations, and ethical considerations.  
* Any additional artifacts, such as screenshots of AI-generated outlines, drafts, or feedback.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. **AI Interaction & Documentation (30%):**  
   * How well did you integrate AI in your project development?  
   * Did you document AI usage clearly and comprehensively?  
2. **Critical Thinking & Application (30%):**  
   * Did you apply AI feedback appropriately and make necessary revisions?  
   * Did you critically assess AI-generated content for accuracy and relevance?  
3. **Original Thought & Creativity (20%):**  
   * Does the final product reflect a balance between AI-generated input and your own unique analysis?  
   * Is there evidence of creative engagement with both AI and the project topic?  
4. **Ethics & Integrity (20%):**  
   * Did you ethically use AI, providing proper credit where necessary?  
   * Does the final submission showcase original effort and critical thinking, rather than a reliance on AI?
