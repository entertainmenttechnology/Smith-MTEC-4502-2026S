# MTEC 4502 – Career and Portfolio Seminar

## Course Repository README

This repository serves as the **living workspace** for MTEC 4502: *Career and Portfolio Seminar*. It is not simply a submission container, but a **professional development environment** designed to mirror how creative technologists, designers, engineers, and media professionals actually work.

The course treats careers as **evolving trajectories**, portfolios as **iterative artifacts**, and AI as a **collaborative partner** rather than a shortcut or replacement for human judgment.

---

## How to Use This Repository

This GitHub repository functions as:

- A **scaffolded record of your career thinking**
- A **place to store and iterate on professional materials**
- A **research notebook** for emerging roles, platforms, and tools
- A **collaborative environment** where feedback, reflection, and revision are visible

Nothing here is considered final in an absolute sense. Instead, this repository represents a **snapshot in an ongoing professional lifecycle**.

## How to Navigate This Repository

Each folder has a specific purpose:

### **`/assignments`**
Assignment briefs and prompts. This is where you'll find detailed instructions for each deliverable.

### **`/course-materials`**
Lesson plans, slides, readings, and other instructional content provided by the instructor.

### **`/resources`**
Reference materials, templates, guides, and curated research (career taxonomy, emerging roles, portfolio platforms, etc.).

### **`/student-work`**
**Your workspace.** When you fork this repository, create a personal folder here (e.g., `firstname-lastname/`) and use it as your professional archive for:
- Assignment submissions
- Reflections and research notes
- Portfolio experiments
- Career planning documents

See [student-work/STUDENT-FOLDER-TEMPLATE.md](student-work/STUDENT-FOLDER-TEMPLATE.md) for folder structure guidelines.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a branch of this repository** 
2. **Clone the repo** to your local machine
3. **Create a folder** in `/student-work` with your name (e.g., `student-work/firstname-lastname/`)
4. **Read assignments** in `/assignments` and submit work in your personal folder
5. **Commit and push regularly** — your process is part of the evaluation

See [course-materials/05-Lesson_Plan_MTEC-4502_2025F.md](course-materials/05-Lesson_Plan_MTEC-4502_2025F.md) for the full course outline and schedule.

### Careers Are Not Static

Many of the roles you may hold **do not yet exist**, and others will change dramatically over the next decade. This course emphasizes:

- Transferable competencies
- Hybrid and emergent roles
- Adaptability over prediction
- Lifelong iteration rather than fixed outcomes

Your goal is not to “lock in” a job title, but to **position yourself for change**.

---

### Portfolios Are Living Documents

Portfolios are treated as:

- Systems for storytelling
- Evidence of thinking and process
- Platforms for experimentation and monetization

They are never complete — only *current*.

---

### AI as a Collaborative Partner

AI is integrated into this course as a **collaborative partner** that can:

- Support brainstorming and speculative thinking
- Assist with analysis and comparison
- Offer alternative perspectives
- Help surface blind spots

Students are expected to:

- Understand and critically evaluate AI output
- Fact-check and contextualize results
- Explicitly document how AI was used

If you do not understand an AI-generated output, **do not use it**.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub is used not because this is a programming course, but because it supports:

- Versioning and iteration
- Transparent process
- Structured collaboration
- Professional documentation practices

GitHub mirrors how many creative, technical, and research teams operate in the real world.

You are not expected to already be fluent in GitHub. Learning to work comfortably in this environment is part of the course.

This repository is not an endpoint.

It is a **working archive** you may return to, revise, fork, or extend long after the course ends — as your career continues to evolve.
