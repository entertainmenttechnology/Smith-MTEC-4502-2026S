# MTEC 4502 – Career and Portfolio Seminar

## Course Repository README

This repository serves as the **living workspace** for MTEC 4502: *Career and Portfolio Seminar*. It is not simply a submission container, but a **professional development environment** designed to mirror how creative technologists, designers, engineers, and media professionals actually work.

The course treats careers as **evolving trajectories**, portfolios as **iterative artifacts**, and AI as a **collaborative partner** rather than a shortcut or replacement for human judgment.

---

## How to Use This Repository

This GitHub repository functions as:

- A **scaffolded record of your career thinking**
- A **place to store and iterate on professional materials**
- A **research notebook** for emerging roles, platforms, and tools
- A **collaborative environment** where feedback, reflection, and revision are visible

Nothing here is considered final in an absolute sense. Instead, this repository represents a **snapshot in an ongoing professional lifecycle**.

## Philosophy of the Course

### Careers Are Not Static

Many of the roles you may hold **do not yet exist**, and others will change dramatically over the next decade. This course emphasizes:

- Transferable competencies
- Hybrid and emergent roles
- Adaptability over prediction
- Lifelong iteration rather than fixed outcomes

Your goal is not to “lock in” a job title, but to **position yourself for change**.

---

### Portfolios Are Living Documents

Portfolios are treated as:

- Systems for storytelling
- Evidence of thinking and process
- Platforms for experimentation and monetization

They are never complete — only *current*.

---

### AI as a Collaborative Partner

AI is integrated into this course as a **collaborative partner** that can:

- Support brainstorming and speculative thinking
- Assist with analysis and comparison
- Offer alternative perspectives
- Help surface blind spots

Students are expected to:

- Understand and critically evaluate AI output
- Fact-check and contextualize results
- Explicitly document how AI was used

If you do not understand an AI-generated output, **do not use it**.

---

## Why GitHub?

GitHub is used not because this is a programming course, but because it supports:

- Versioning and iteration
- Transparent process
- Structured collaboration
- Professional documentation practices

GitHub mirrors how many creative, technical, and research teams operate in the real world.

You are not expected to already be fluent in GitHub. Learning to work comfortably in this environment is part of the course.

## Repository Structure (High-Level)

> **Note:** Detailed folder documentation may be auto-generated or expanded using AI tools.

Typical contents include:

- `/assignments` – Assignment prompts and deliverables
- `/documents` – Shared readings, references, and templates
- `/reflections` – Structured reflection materials
- `/portfolio-research` – Platform evaluations and notes
- `/visualizations` – Career maps, diagrams, and planning tools

---

## Assessment Philosophy

Assessment focuses on:

- Depth of engagement
- Quality of research and reasoning
- Thoughtful use of AI
- Iteration and responsiveness to feedback

Polish matters, but **process matters more**.

## A Final Note

This repository is not an endpoint.

It is a **working archive** you may return to, revise, fork, or extend long after the course ends — as your career continues to evolve.

Welcome to MTEC 4502.
