# Accessibility Tests

This directory contains tests to ensure WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance for markdown files in the repository.

## Available Tests

### test-student-folder-template-heading.sh
Tests that `student-work/STUDENT-FOLDER-TEMPLATE.md` contains a level-one heading as required by WCAG 2.1 (page-has-heading-one rule).

**Usage:**
```bash
./tests/test-student-folder-template-heading.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ student-work/STUDENT-FOLDER-TEMPLATE.md has a level-one heading
```

### check-lang-attribute.sh
Checks that markdown files listed in the script have a `lang:` entry in their YAML front matter.
This satisfies the `html-has-lang` axe/WCAG 2.1 accessibility rule, which requires every HTML
document to declare a language on the `<html>` element.

**Usage:**
```bash
./tests/check-lang-attribute.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ assignments/01a-d Scaffolded Assignment_ Reflective and analytical essay.md
```

### check-markdown-accessibility.sh
Checks all markdown files in the repository for level-one headings.

**Usage:**
```bash
./tests/check-markdown-accessibility.sh
```
