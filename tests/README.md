# Accessibility Tests

This directory contains tests to ensure WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance for markdown files in the repository.

## Available Tests

### test-student-folder-template-heading.sh
Tests that `student-work/STUDENT-FOLDER-TEMPLATE.md` contains a level-one heading as required by WCAG 2.1 (page-has-heading-one rule).

**Usage:**
```bash
./tests/test-student-folder-template-heading.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ student-work/STUDENT-FOLDER-TEMPLATE.md has a level-one heading
```

### check-markdown-accessibility.sh
Checks all markdown files in the repository for level-one headings.

**Usage:**
```bash
./tests/check-markdown-accessibility.sh
```

### check-heading-order.sh
Checks that heading levels in markdown files don't skip levels (e.g., h2 → h4 is invalid; h2 → h3 is valid). This ensures compliance with the axe `heading-order` rule and WCAG 2.1 guidelines. Optionally accepts a specific file path as an argument.

**Usage:**
```bash
./tests/check-heading-order.sh
# or for a specific file:
./tests/check-heading-order.sh resources/11_resume_development_guide.md
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ All markdown files have valid heading order
```

## Running Tests

To run all accessibility tests:
```bash
cd /path/to/repository
./tests/test-student-folder-template-heading.sh
./tests/check-markdown-accessibility.sh
./tests/check-heading-order.sh
```

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance

These tests help ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 accessibility requirements:
- **Level A:** Pages should have a level-one heading.
- **heading-order:** Heading levels should only increase by one (no skipped levels).

This is important for:
- Screen reader navigation
- Document structure and semantics
- Accessibility scanning tools
